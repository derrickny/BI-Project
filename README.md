This project focuses on text-based classification, specifically in the domain of fact-checking statements. The dataset comprises statements paired with verdicts, where the verdicts are binary labels indicating the statements' truthfulness. The goal is to develop and evaluate machine learning models for automating the classification of statements as either true or false.

The project involves tasks such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to extract meaningful features from the textual data. Additionally, statistical tests, including chi-square analysis, are performed to explore relationships between categorical variables.

The evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are employed to assess the performance of the models. The project provides insights into the efficiency of different algorithms in handling the fact-checking task and aims to contribute to the field of automated content verification.
